# 9. Conclusion

We have designed a system that can securely and efficiently incentivize data delivery over low bandwidth MANETs. Existing payment channel protocols do not focus on efficiently routing data and payments at the same time over multiple low bandwidth hops. We solve this problem by using a more data efficient channel update scheme and signature aggregation to settle transactions. We believe our system opens up a flexible design space for optimizing the coverage and reliability of mobile mesh networks in a way that preserves their decentralization.
