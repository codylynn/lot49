# 10. Acknowledgments

Our work was inspired and is made possible by the development of the Bitcoin Lightning Network by Poon and Dryja, the eltoo update scheme proposed by Decker, Russell, and Osuntokun and the MuSig signature aggregation scheme of Maxwell, Poelstra, Seurin and Wuille.

We would like to thank Daniela Perdomo and the goTenna team for their generous support of this project. Thanks to Albert Wenger and Nick Gross from USV for their encouragement, review and suggestions. Thanks to Jay Graber for early discussions that led to this proposal.

We are also grateful to the readers of early drafts of this proposal who generously took time to give us useful suggestions, constructive criticisms and thoughtful feedback: Nic Carter, Adam Gibson, Elaine Ou, Lucas Ryan, Arthur Demeester, Alex Akselrod, Mats-Erik Pistol, Bob McElrath, Teemu PÃ¤ivinen, Dan Robinson, Peter Todd, Steve Myers, Robin Chan, Fabian Jahr,
